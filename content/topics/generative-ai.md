## Prerequisites

- Neural Networks concepts
- Basic understanding of attention mechanisms
- API usage experience

## Key Concepts

### Large Language Models
- **Transformers**: Attention-based architecture
- **Pre-training**: Learning from massive text corpora
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting to specific tasks

### Prompt Engineering
Techniques for better outputs:
- **Zero-shot**: Direct instructions
- **Few-shot**: Include examples
- **Chain-of-thought**: Step-by-step reasoning
- **System prompts**: Set behavior and constraints

### Practical Applications
- Content generation and summarization
- Code assistance and debugging
- Document analysis and extraction
- Creative ideation support

## When to Use

Generative AI excels for:
- Tasks requiring language understanding
- Creative content generation
- Rapid prototyping of ideas
- Augmenting human capabilities

Avoid when:
- Exact numerical precision required
- Full verifiability needed
- Domain expertise is critical

## Common Pitfalls

- Hallucinations (confident but wrong outputs)
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Over-reliance without verification
- Ignoring token limits and costs
- Not testing edge cases
