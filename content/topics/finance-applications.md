# Finance Applications

ML applications in financial services and risk management.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this topic, you will:
- Apply ML to risk measurement (VaR, CVaR)
- Understand portfolio optimization approaches
- Implement credit risk and fraud detection models
- Navigate regulatory requirements

## Visual Guides

### Risk Metrics

*Portfolio performance with Value at Risk (VaR)*

### Portfolio Allocation

*Comparing forecasting approaches*

## Prerequisites

- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Basic financial concepts
- Understanding of probability distributions

## Key Concepts

### Risk Management
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Maximum expected loss at confidence level
- **Conditional VaR (CVaR)**: Expected loss beyond VaR
- **Stress Testing**: Scenario-based risk assessment

### Portfolio Optimization
- Mean-variance optimization (Markowitz)
- Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)
- Factor-based approaches

### Credit & Fraud
- Credit scoring models
- Default probability estimation
- Anomaly detection for fraud
- Transaction monitoring

### Regulatory Framework
- SR 11-7 model risk management
- MiFID II compliance
- Explainability requirements

## When to Use

ML in finance is appropriate for:
- Pattern recognition at scale
- Real-time decision support
- Risk quantification
- Process automation

Use caution when:
- Full transparency required
- Small sample sizes
- Regime changes expected

## Common Pitfalls

- Overfitting to historical patterns
- Ignoring non-stationarity
- Underestimating tail risks
- Model risk from complexity
- Regulatory non-compliance
