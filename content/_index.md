# Machine Learning for Smarter Innovation

A BSc-level course bridging Machine Learning and AI with Design Thinking methodologies.

## The Innovation Diamond

Our core concept visualizes the innovation process: expansion from 1 challenge through divergent thinking to 5000 possibilities, then convergence through ML filtering to 5 strategic solutions.

## Learning Approach

This course demonstrates how machine learning augments human-centered design processes through:

- **Practical Applications**: Real-world case studies and hands-on projects
- **Algorithm Understanding**: Deep dives into ML algorithms with actual implementations
- **Design Integration**: Connecting ML capabilities with design thinking stages
- **Ethical Considerations**: Responsible AI and fairness in ML systems
